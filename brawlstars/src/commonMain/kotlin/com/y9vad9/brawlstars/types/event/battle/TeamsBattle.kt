/**
 * Represents a standard team battle that impacts player trophies.
 *
 * These battles involve regular 3-vs-3 or 5-vs-5 gameplay where the outcome directly affects
 * player rankings and trophy counts.
 *
 * ## Known limitations
 * After a mega tree (basically mega pig), we can learn that it will
 * be passed into this category for the lack of unique traits, except
 * [Event.mode] == [EventMode.UNKNOWN] for some of the modes. We don't have reliable
 * data to determine such events.
 *
 * ### Way around
 * But there's still way around if you need to figure out at least most battles:
 * - Such events have predefined range of [EventMode]s, so start your conditioning on it.
 * - Such events have no [trophyChange] (that equal to zero) when [result] == [BattleResultKind.DEFEAT]
 * or when [result] == [BattleResultKind.VICTORY].
 * - Partially if a player uses the brawler with high-trophies, for [result] == [BattleResultKind.DRAW]
 * it might still have effect on brawler's trophies.
 *
 * In case if it's a brawler under 1100 trophies (I am not sure for now from which trophies
 * does Brawl Stars take trophies, but probably it's not less than 1100 trophies), you
 * cannot determine such battles as a Mega Pig or of such kind. If you find a way to do so,
 * please report it on library's issues â€“ it will be highly appreciated.
 *
