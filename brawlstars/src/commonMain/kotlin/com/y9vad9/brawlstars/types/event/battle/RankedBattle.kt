/**
 * Represents a friendly ranked game battle, which may be assumed based on incomplete data.
 *
 * Any friendly ranked game battle is **ASSUMED**, meaning that there's no
 * actual indicator on the Brawl Stars API side – it is inferred by other battles.
 *
 * It's for the most part reliable data, excluding very exclusive cases (when you're directly
 * trying to break the algorithm, but even in this situation, most known cases
 * are covered).
 *
 * ## How it's inferred?
 * Friendly ranked game battles are inferred by the following rules:
 * - `battle.mode` is playable ranked game (showdown, for example, is excluded)
 * - Every ranked game has last game with `battle.result == victory || defeat`
 *
 * ### How rounds are inferred?
 * Although Brawl Stars itself cannot display friendly ranked matches as one even within the game,
 * we can infer it by following rules:
 * - First game, as was mentioned before, should be victory or defeat (no draw can be, it will be finished at least by
 * bots, or it will be a specially made long-ride match).
 * - 'Battles' below should be without `starPlayer` defined (null) – it's the rule, because as was mentioned
 * there cannot be any draws or games without actions.
 * - 'Battles' events, teams, mode should be equal and its time should within a reasonable timeframe.
 *
 * ## Known limitations
 * - If it's the last battle can be obtained log, it will be marked as regular [TeamsBattle].
 * - If there's no final round, all rounds until then will be marked as [TeamsBattle].
 * - I assume that after some period of time ranked battle can be finished by force by Brawl Stars itself,
 * so better to check [rounds] count and overall [totalDuration] with some reasonable time. At our side
 * we set a 25-minute limit for friendly matches, but you may validate it yourself.
